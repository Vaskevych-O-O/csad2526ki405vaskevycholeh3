Prompt 1:
Create a new bash script called ci.sh that automates the local build process for a CMake project. Write all responses in English.


Answer:
I'll create a `ci.sh` script that automates the CMake configure, build, and test process. I'll add a todo for this task, create the script with proper permissions, and document its usage. 

Added 2 todos

I'll create the `ci.sh` script with error handling, colorful output, and build configuration options. 

Created [](file:///workspaces/csad2526ki405vaskevycholeh3/ci.sh)

Now I'll make the script executable: 

Ran terminal command: chmod +x ci.sh



Prompt 2:
Inside ci.sh, generate commands that:

1. Create a build directory if it doesn't exist (mkdir -p build)

2. Change into that directory (cd build)

3. Run CMake configuration (cmake ..)

4. Build the project (cmake --build .)

Run tests using ctest --output-on-failure
After creating the file, also include instructions in comments to run chmod +x ci.sh to make it executable.
The script should exit immediately if any command fails.


Answer:
I'll update the ci.sh script to be simpler and match your exact requirements, including the chmod instruction in comments.

I'll update the todo list to reflect the changes: 

Completed (1/2) *Create ci.sh script*

I've updated the ci.sh script to match your requirements exactly:

1. Created a simpler script that:
   - Creates build directory with `mkdir -p build`
   - Changes into it with `cd build`
   - Runs CMake configuration with `cmake ..`
   - Builds with `cmake --build .`
   - Runs tests with `ctest --output-on-failure`
2. Added the `chmod +x ci.sh` instruction as a comment at the top
3. Included `set -e` to exit immediately if any command fails

To use the script:
1. First make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ci.sh
```
2. Then run it:
```bash
./ci.sh
```

The script will exit with a non-zero status if any step fails (configuration, build, or tests).



Prompt 3:
Please correct the URL for googletest; the URL currently in use is invalid.


Answer:
I'll update the GoogleTest URL in CMakeLists.txt to use the correct GitHub release URL. The current URL is missing the proper GitHub raw content path. 

Використовуючи "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've updated the GoogleTest URL in CMakeLists.txt. The changes:
- Old URL: `https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.14.0.zip`
- New URL: `https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/v1.14.0.zip`

The new URL points to the correct release archive on GitHub. The script should now be able to download GoogleTest successfully during the CMake configuration step.

You can now run ci.sh again to test the build with the corrected URL.



Prompt 4:
ci.sh script can`t found unit_tests, please fix this


Answer:
The issue is that the unit tests aren't being found by CTest because we need to update our test script to use Google Test framework instead of our custom test runner. I'll modify `unit_tests.cpp` to use Google Test properly, as it's already set up in our CMakeLists.txt.

```

```
I've updated `unit_tests.cpp` to use the Google Test framework properly. The changes:

1. Replaced the custom test runner with proper Google Test syntax
2. Added `gtest/gtest.h` include
3. Converted test cases to use `TEST` macro and `EXPECT_EQ` assertions
4. Removed manual `main()` function (it's provided by `gtest_main` that we link to in CMakeLists.txt)

Now the tests will be properly discovered by CTest. Try running the CI script again:

```bash
./ci.sh
```

The script should now:
1. Configure CMake successfully
2. Build both the main executable and the unit tests
3. Run the tests through CTest and find them properly

The tests will show up in the CTest output with proper Google Test formatting and results.
