Prompt 1:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file named ci.yml inside the .github/workflows/ directory.
The workflow should:

Trigger on push or pull request events to any branch that includes "develop" or "master" in its name.

Contain a single job called cross_build.

Use a matrix strategy to run on ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, and macos-latest.

Include the following steps for each OS:

Checkout the repository using actions/checkout@v4.

Install CMake (if it’s not already available).

Run the configuration and build script from Stage 3.

Add a Deploy step (it can be a placeholder command for now).
Make sure the workflow is syntactically correct and ready to commit.


Answer:
I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow file with the specified requirements. First, I'll make sure the workflows directory exists, then create the ci.yml file. 

Created [](file:///workspaces/csad2526ki405vaskevycholeh3/.github/workflows)

Now I'll create the workflow file with all the required specifications: 

Created [](file:///workspaces/csad2526ki405vaskevycholeh3/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

I've created the GitHub Actions workflow file with the following features:

1. **Triggers**:
   - Activates on push and pull request events
   - Matches any branch containing "develop" or "master"

2. **Job Configuration**:
   - Single job named `cross_build`
   - Matrix strategy for three operating systems
   - Uses latest versions of Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS

3. **Steps**:
   - Checkout code using `actions/checkout@v4`
   - Install CMake using `lukka/get-cmake@latest`
   - Make ci.sh executable (skipped on Windows)
   - Run the build script (ci.sh)
   - Execute tests using CTest
   - Placeholder deployment step

4. **Special Considerations**:
   - Uses bash shell consistently across all platforms
   - Handles script permissions for Unix-like systems
   - Separates build and test steps for better error reporting

The workflow is ready to commit and will execute the cross-platform build process automatically when triggered.

To test this workflow locally, you can:
1. Commit the file
2. Push to a branch with "develop" in its name
3. Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the workflow configuration?
